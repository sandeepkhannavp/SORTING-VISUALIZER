# SORTING-VISUALIZER

Implementation of sorting visualizer using graphics.h - for (20XT17) C PROGRAMMING LAB @PSG COLLEGE OF TECHNOLOGY

A sorting visualizer written in c++ using its graphics.h library where I have implemented an interface to
Visualize various sorting algorithms including

Here we populate the array initially - you can also add the inout functionality

## 1) BUBBLE SORT:

--> It is an adaptive and stable algorithm with O(n^2) time complexity\
--> For n elements , if you perform K passes , K elements are sorted down - K largest elements - lighter elements move up, heavier moves down\
--> We perform n-1 passes

The interface also displays the iterations roughly tracking the time complexitites of the algorithms
