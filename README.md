# SORTING-VISUALIZER
Implementation of sorting visualizer using graphics.h

A sorting visualizer written in c++ using its graphics.h library where I have implemented an interface to
Visualize various sorting algorithms including

-Insertion Sort
-Selection Sort
-Quick Sort
-Count Sort
-Bubble Sort

The interface also displays the iterations roughly tracking the time complexitites of the algorithms
