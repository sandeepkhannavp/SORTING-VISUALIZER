# SORTING-VISUALIZER

Implementation of sorting visualizer using graphics.h - for (20XT17) C PROGRAMMING LAB @PSG COLLEGE OF TECHNOLOGY

A sorting visualizer written in c++ using its graphics.h library where I have implemented an interface to
Visualize various sorting algorithms including

Here we populate the array initially - you can also add the inout functionality

INITIAL ARRAY

## 1) BUBBLE SORT:

--> It is an adaptive and stable algorithm with O(n^2) time complexity\
--> For n elements , if you perform K passes , K elements are sorted down - K largest elements - lighter elements move up, heavier moves down\
--> We perform n-1 passes

Execution time - 979.461 seconds

## 2) QUICK SORT:

--> We select an element and find the position, also it works on partitions\
--> Has the average case time complexity of O(nlogn)

Execution time - 979.461 seconds

## 3) INSERTION SORT:

--> We assume first element is sorted , take out an element insert and sort and we repeat the same process\
--> (n-1) passes , O(n^2) comparisons , O(n^2) number of swaps\
--> Intermediate results are not useful like bubble sort 
--> It is adaptive and stable by nature\

Execution time - 979.461 seconds

## 4) SELECTION SORT

--> In k passes , we sort k smaller elements unlike bubble sort where we sort k largest elements\
--> The sort performs minimum number of swaps\
--> It is neither adaptive nor stable - O(n^2) time complexity

Execution time - 979.461 seconds
